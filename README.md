"# csharp-training-method" 

# In order to create a new csharp project we need to create a console with the command

dotnet new console -o ./CsharpProjects/TestProject

with " ./CsharpProjects/TestProject" being the path of the project

TestProject : being the file name of the project ( need to test to see if CsharpProjects is necessary)

to run the project we run the command "dotnet run" inside the directory where ".csproj" is place

we code in the file Program.cs
